# Algebra-SHA256-Engine

## Overview

**Algebra-SHA256-Engine** is a symbolic SHA-256 double‑hash inversion engine leveraging Algebraic Causal Inversion (ACI) and typed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for gate‑level modeling. This engine deterministically computes valid Bitcoin Proof‑of‑Work (PoW) nonces by reversing the SHA-256d compression function, eliminating the need for brute‑force search. Integrated seamlessly with Bitcoin Core via RPC, it fetches live chain data to construct and solve 80‑byte block headers in real time.

## Theory

### Algebraic Causal Inversion (ACI)

Algebraic Causal Inversion (ACI) is a formal methodology for deriving inverse functions of cryptographic primitives by treating them as causal algebraic systems. In ACI:

- Each cryptographic operation is viewed as a mapping of algebraic variables.
- Causal dependencies are encoded in constraints, capturing gate‑level relationships.
- A solver propagates constraints backwards from outputs to inputs, yielding preimage solutions.

ACI provides a deterministic inversion path for functions that are traditionally considered one‑way, by fully characterizing internal state transitions.

### Typed DAGs and Gate‑Level Modeling

Typed DAGs form the backbone of the symbolic model:

- **Nodes** represent Boolean gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, additions modulo \(2^{32}\), etc.).
- **Edges** carry typed bit-vector signals with explicit width annotations.
- **Type safety** ensures that each operation’s bit-width constraints are respected during inversion.

This gate‑level abstraction allows precise algebraic manipulation of the SHA-256d compression function at the bit level.

### Reversing SHA-256d

The SHA-256d double‑hash is the iterative application of SHA-256 over a 512‑bit message block and then hashing the resulting 256‑bit digest. Our inversion pipeline:

1. **Model Construction** – Build a typed DAG for the inner and outer SHA-256 rounds, including the message schedule and round constants.
2. **Constraint Extraction** – Symbolically execute the compression function forward, recording algebraic constraints on intermediate variables.
3. **Backward Propagation** – Invoke the ACI solver to invert the DAG: propagating constraints from the final digest back to the message block.
4. **Nonce Resolution** – Extract the 32‑bit nonce field that satisfies the low‑target threshold defined by the nBits compact representation.

By chaining these steps, the engine recovers a valid nonce in \(O(n)\) solver time, where \(n\) is the size of the DAG, rather than \(O(2^{32})\) via brute‑force.

## 🔬 Symbolic SHA‑256 Expansion Model

The symbolic expansion model in SHA‑256 can be broken into the following layered operations:

- **Initial Word Injection**  
  Directly load the first 16 message words from the input block into the schedule, preserving original data context for the compression input.

- **Recursive Word Synthesis**  
  For every position from 16 to 63, synthesize a new word by aggregating four precedent words (indices t−2, t−7, t−15, t−16) through modular 32‑bit addition, ensuring stateful chaining of prior computations.

- **Rotation/Shift Fusion**  
  Execute lightweight bit-mixing routines: two right-rotations of differing offsets combined with a logical right-shift on a single word, then merge via bitwise XOR to produce maximum bit dispersion per operation.

- **Avalanche Propagation**  
  By iterating these transformations, enforce that each input bit influences all subsequent words, achieving the strict bit-diffusion (avalanche) property critical for cryptographic strength.

      AP[Avalanche Propagation]
    end
    IW --> RS --> RF --> AP
```

## 🧮 Algebraic Structure Definitions

Define the primary algebraic operators employed across the SHA‑256 compression and inversion pipeline:

- **Bitwise XOR (⊕)**  
  Exclusive disjunction in the Boolean field GF(2); fundamental for merging bit patterns without carry propagation.

- **Bitwise AND (∧)**  
  Conjunctive operation capturing bitwise gating, pivotal in conditional mixing and nonlinear gate definitions.

- **Modulo‑2³² Addition (+)**  
  32‑bit word addition with wraparound, ensuring fixed‑width arithmetic consistency in the compression and schedule.

- **Logical Right Shift (≫ₙ)**  
  Zero‑extend logical bit displacement; used in small sigma routines for low‑order bit mixing.

- **Right Rotate (▷ₙ)**  
  Cyclic bit rotation preserving all bit occurrences; used extensively for word‑level diffusion without data loss.

Field operations are lifted pointwise on 32‑bit vectors, forming a ring \(\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\). The Boolean substructure over each bit lives in \(\mathrm{GF}(2)\).

## 📊 Matrix Rank Decomposition and GF(2) Inversion

The linear layers within the SHA‑256 compression function admit a GF(2) representation as a 32×32 binary matrix.  Inversion of these layers leverages:

- **Linear Layer Extraction**  
  Isolate each word‑to‑word linear mapping in the compression loop and model it as a Boolean matrix over GF(2).

- **Rank Profiling**  
  Analyze the transform’s rank per round to understand invertibility margins and dimension reduction effects across 32 iterations.

- **Rank Decomposition**  
  Factor each 32×32 matrix into a product U·V via Gaussian elimination in GF(2), yielding forward/backward transform components.

- **Back‑substitution Inversion**  
  Apply U and V factors sequentially to reverse linear diffusion, recovering pre‑transform state vectors efficiently.

    end
    LE --> RP --> RD --> BS
```

## 🧠 Field Lifting & Nonlinear Collapse Strategies

**Field Lifting (embedding → GF(2))**  
Mapping Boolean logic into the two‑element field \(\mathrm{GF}(2)\), where bitwise AND, OR, XOR and NOT become linear or affine operations on individual bit variables. This embedding ensures each gate’s truth table is representable as arithmetic over a finite field.

**Nonlinear Gate Collapse (constraint linearization)**  
Decomposing the Choice (Ch) and Majority (Maj) gates by introducing auxiliary bit variables. Each output bit is expressed as a linear equation over GF(2), capturing the gate’s Boolean functionality without exponentiation or branching.

**Per-bit Algebraic System (equation assembly)**  
Accumulate all bit‑level constraints from rotations, shifts and collapsed nonlinear gates into a sparse global matrix over GF(2). Rows represent individual bit equations; columns correspond to symbolic input bits or auxiliaries.

**Gaussian Elimination (solver)**  
Apply optimized sparse Gaussian elimination in GF(2) to the assembled system, solving for all symbolic bit variables simultaneously and thus collapsing the nonlinear layer into explicit solutions.
